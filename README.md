# GitHub Dashboard App

This React app serves as a dashboard/portfolio that integrates with GitHub, allowing users to view their GitHub activity and repository details.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main directories: `client` and `server`. The `client` directory contains the front-end React app, while the `server` directory, if present, might house the back-end server for additional functionalities.

## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Change directory to the `client` folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
3. Install dependencies:
    npm install
After installing dependencies, you can use the available scripts to run, test, or build the React app.

## GitHub Integration
The app provides a comprehensive view of your GitHub activities and repository details. You can see your GitHub projects, activities, and learn more about each repository.
